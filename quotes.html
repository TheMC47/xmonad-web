<h3>xmonad reviews and quotes</h3>

<p>
``XMonad is by far the best Window Manager around. It's one of the reasons I
stick with Linux. Itâ€™s stuffed with great features you can easily compose
with your config file to get a fine-tuned behaviour.''

``I've started replacing machines that run Awesome, with XMonad, and I'm not looking back. Ever.''

``I have to say, the greatest thing about xmonad thus far is its insane
stability. Even in wmii, I'd often find myself having to manually run
wmiistartrc because my modkey would stop working right, but I have zero
issues with xmonad''

``Over the past twelve months, 34 developers contributed new code to
xmonad.  This is one of the largest open-source teams in the world, and
is in the top 2% of all project teams on Ohloh.

Across all Haskell projects on Ohloh, 21% of all source code lines are
comments. For xmonad, this figure is 45%. This very impressive number of
comments puts xmonad among the best 10% of all Haskell projects on
Ohloh.

A high number of comments might indicate that the code is
well-documented and organized, and could be a sign of a helpful and
disciplined development team.''
