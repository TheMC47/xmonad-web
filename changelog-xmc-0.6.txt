  * cleared up transience to better highlight how to use ManageHooks properly
  
  The initial patch that extended the EDSL for writing ManageHook rules did not come with a good example on how to use it.  This patch ammends that. 'move' is an example of how to write a rule to resolve a Query (Maybe a) into something tangible.  'move'' is an example of how to write a rule isolating window managing code from the rest ofthe mess the EDSL creates.

  * expands the EDSL for performing actions on windows
  
  This patch adds a few types of relationships and operators for managing windows with rules.  It provides grouping operators so the X action can access the quantifier that was matched or not matched.  It provides a formalism for predicates that work in both grouping and non grouping rules.  It could do with some classes, so that there are fewer operators that always do the Right Thing (TM), but the Haskell Type system currently has some problems resolving types.  Since I don't know enough about these high level things, it would be hard to create a GHC patch just to make it all work.

  * Timer: some code cleanup

Mon Jan 14 12:28:33 PST 2008  nicolas.pouillard@gmail.com
  * Use doubleFork instead of manual double fork, or buggy single fork.
  
  This fixes showWName because Timer was leaking zombie processes.
  You should update xmonad, since doubleFork was not exported.

  * display all visible windows on the current desktop in the pager
  This is my best shot at modeling xmonad[_\e2_][_\80_][_\99_]s WM behaviour in a way that
  the Extended Window Manager Hints specification allows.
  
  Unfortunately, we can not tell the panel what size and position it should
  think the apps are.

  * Fix isssue 105
  issue 105 was due to the fact that tab windows created when
  bootstrapping the windowset after a restart where managed. Setting the
  override_redirect attributes to True fixes the issue.
  
  Added the possibility to set the override_redirect attribute with
  XMonad.Util.XUtils.creationNewWindow

  * Prompt.hs: mv .xmonad_history into .xmonad/
  See my email to mailing list. This will slightly break anyone who upgrades while running and expects to see their prompt history, and leave a stray file, I think, but nothing else, and it'll permanently improve tab-completion, and is tidier.

  Someone with Xinerama should look at this -- I don't know exactly how that
  should behave.

Thu Dec 13 12:51:59 PST 2007  gwern0@gmail.com
  * +XMonad.Util.Search: new module
  This module is intended to provide helpful functions for easily running web searchs; just hit a bound key, enter your query, and up opens a new tab/browser/window with the search results. In theory anyway; the Wikipedia and Google ones work fine for me, but the Internet Archive's docs on how to do don't necessarily seem to be correct. If you were, like me, previously running shell commands to call Surfraw or similar shell scripts to do the same thing, you can now scrap them and replace them.
  
  There aren't too many search engines defined here; new ones would be good, and they're easy to add!

Wed Dec 12 18:17:04 PST 2007  Spencer Janssen 
  * Add support for _NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL

Sun Dec  9 18:10:30 PST 2007  Spencer Janssen

  arrival.)
