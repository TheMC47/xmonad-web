The xmonad dev team is pleased to announce the 0.6 release of xmonad! 

                           http://xmonad.org

xmonad is a tiling window manager for X. Windows are arranged
automatically to tile the screen without gaps or overlap, maximising
screen use. Window manager features are accessible from the keyboard: a
mouse is optional. xmonad is extensible in Haskell, allowing for
powerful customisation. Custom layout algorithms, key bindings and other
extensions may be written by the user in config files. Layouts are
applied dynamically, and different layouts may be used on each
workspace. Xinerama is fully supported, allowing windows to be tiled on
several physical screens.

Features:

    * Very stable, fast, small and simple.
    * Automatic window tiling and management
    * First class keyboard support: a mouse is unnecessary
    * Full support for tiling windows on multi-head displays
    * Full support for floating windows
    * XRandR support to rotate, add or remove monitors
    * Per-workspace layout algorithms
    * Per-screens custom status bars
    * Easy, powerful customisation and reconfiguration in Haskell
    * Large extension library
    * Extensive documentation and support for hacking

Extensions:

    xmonad comes with a huge library of extensions (now more than 5
    times the size of xmonad), contributed by viewers like you.

    Extensions enable pretty much arbitrary window manager behaviour to
    be implemented by users, in Haskell, in the config files.
    For more information on using and writing extensions see the webpage.
    The library of extensions is available from hackage:

        http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/xmonad-contrib

    Full documentation for using and writing your own extensions:
