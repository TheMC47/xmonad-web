    <h3>about</h3>

    <p>
    Xmonad is a <i>tiling window manager</i> for X. Windows are arranged
    automatically to tile the screen without gaps or overlap, maximising
    screen use. All features of the window manager are accessible from
    the keyboard: a mouse is strictly optional. Xmonad is written and
    extensible in <a
        href="http://haskell.org">Haskell</a>. Custom layout
    algorithms, and other extensions, may be written by the user in
    config files. Layouts are applied dynamically, and different
    layouts may be used on each workspace. A guiding principle of the
    user interface is <i>predictability</i>: users should know in
    advance precisely the window arrangement that will result from any
    action, leading to an intuitive user interface.

    <h4>tiling the screen</h4>

    <p>
    Xmonad provides three tiling algorithms by default: <i>tall</i>,
    <i>wide</i> and <i>fullscreen</i>. In tall or wide mode, all windows
    are visible and tiled to fill the plane without gaps. In fullscreen
    mode only the focused window is visible, filling the screen.
    Alternative tiling algorithms are provided as <a
        href="./contrib.html">extensions</a>. Sets of
    windows are grouped together on virtual <i>workspaces</i> and each
    workspace retains its own layout. Multiple physical monitors are
    supported via Xinerama, allowing simultaneous display of several
    workspaces. </p>

    <h4>simple and flexible</h4>

    <p>
    Adhering to a minimalist philosophy of doing one job, and doing it
    well, the entire code base remains tiny, and is written to be simple
    to understand and modify. By using Haskell as a configuration
    language arbitrarily complex extensions may be implemented by the
    user using a powerful `scripting' language, without needing to
    modify the window manager directly. For example, users <a
        href="./contrib.html">may write</a> their own tiling algorithms,
    in Haskell, in their config files.
    </p>

    <h4>policies and high assurance</h4>

    <p>
    From the outset correctness and robustness have been a goal of the
    project. Using a combination of static and dynamic techniques,
    a wide range of errors are prevented and checkable, leading to
    better, cleaner code, and a more stable application. In particular,
    the expressive Haskell type system is used to prevent certain
    classes of bugs, while type-based automatic testing and <a
        href="http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~ndm/catch/">verification tools</a>,
    are used to ensure the user interface <a 
        href="http://code.haskell.org/xmonad/tests/Properties.hs">policies</a> 
    are correct (for example, that a layout algorithm never produces
    gaps or overlapping windows, or that window manager actions never
    produce an inconsistent internal state).
