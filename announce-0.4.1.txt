The xmonad strike force is pleased to announce the 0.4.1 release of xmonad! 

This is a maintainence release with simpler build dependencies. The
X11-extras library is no longer required, and instead xmonad uses the
improved X11 binding: X11-1.3.0

In other respects this release is functionally identical to xmonad 0.4.

As usual, you can find the latest and great codes on hackage:
