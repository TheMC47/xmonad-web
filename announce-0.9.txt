The xmonad dev team is pleased to announce xmonad 0.9!
We think this is a great release.

The headlines:

    * Actions.SpawnOn: Windows go to the workspace they were launched
          on, even if you're no longer viewing that workspace.  Especially
          handy for slow-launching applications like Firefox
    * Actions.GridSelect: graphically go to, select, do things with
          windows, workspaces, prompts ... 
    * Many new window layouts: http://is.gd/4BzAI
    * Many new scriptable actions: http://is.gd/4BzCN
    * Focus changes across screens with mouse movement, no longer
          requiring a click, even for empty workspaces. 
    * Improved xmobar/dzen statusbar functions, easier to use, more compositional
    * New --restart command line flag to restart a running xmonad process.
    * Supports for multi-module local configuration files
    * Support for user-defined X event handling 
    * xmonad comes with 180 extensions for enhancing functionality
    * Over 3000 commits have been made to the project.

Extensions:

    xmonad comes with a huge library of extensions (now around 15
    times the size of xmonad itself), contributed by viewers like you.

    Extensions allow for all sorts of functionality and enhancements to
    the window manager, via Haskell in your config file. For more
    information on using and writing extensions see the webpage.  The
    library of extensions is available from hackage:

        http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/xmonad-contrib

    Full documentation for using and writing your own extensions:
