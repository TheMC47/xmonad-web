The xmonad dev team is pleased to announce xmonad 0.7!

The headlines:

    The 0.7 release of xmonad provides several improvements over 0.6, including
    improved integration with GNOME, more flexible "rules", various stability
    fixes, and of course, many new and interesting features in the extension
    library (general support for window decorations, utf8 support, scratch pad
    terminals, pointer control) and more!

New GNOME support:

    Active, automated support for GNOME utilities. We know our users
    often like to use GNOME menus, tools and status bars, and we'd like
    to announce that xmonad actively supports GNOME! Extensions for
    communicating with and utilising gnome utilities come in the library
    suite, as well as extensive documentation and support. For more information
    see the GNOME/xmonad integration page on the wiki.

A period of active development:

    In the past year, the xmonad development team received contributions
    from over 60 developers, making xmonad one of the largest window
    manager development teams around, and dwarfing other tiling window
    manager projects. Yet, at the same time, the core code base remains at
    around 1000 lines of code, with another 7000 lines in the extension
    library -- a significant achievment!

About:

    xmonad is a tiling window manager for X. Windows are arranged
    automatically to tile the screen without gaps or overlap, maximising
    screen use. Window manager features are accessible from the keyboard: a
    mouse is optional. xmonad is extensible in Haskell, allowing for
    powerful customisation. Custom layout algorithms, key bindings and other
    extensions may be written by the user in config files. Layouts are
    applied dynamically, and different layouts may be used on each
    workspace. Xinerama is fully supported, allowing windows to be tiled on
    several physical screens.

Features:

   * Very stable, fast, small and simple.
   * Automatic window tiling and management
   * First class keyboard support: a mouse is unnecessary
   * Full support for tiling windows on multi-head displays
   * Full support for floating, tabbing and decorated windows
   * Full support for Gnome and KDE utilities
   * XRandR support to rotate, add or remove monitors
   * Per-workspace layout algorithms
   * Per-screens custom status bars
   * Compositing support
   * Powerful, stable customisation and reconfiguration
   * Large extension library
   * Excellent, extensive documentation
   * Large, active development team, support and community

    Information, screenshots, documentation, tutorials and community
    resources are available from the xmonad home page:

        http://xmonad.org

    The 0.7 release, and its dependencies, are available from hackage.haskell.org:

        http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/xmonad

    xmonad packages are available in the package systems of at least:

        Debian, Gentoo, Arch, Ubuntu, OpenBSD,
        NetBSD, FreeBSD, Gobo, NixOS, Source Mage, Slackware

    and 0.7 packages will appear in coming days (some are already available).

    On the fly updating to xmonad 0.7 is supported. You should be able
    to upgrade to xmonad 0.7 from 0.6 and earlier, transparently,
    without losing your session. Load the new code with mod-q and enjoy.

Extensions:

    xmonad comes with a huge library of extensions (now more than 7
    times the size of xmonad itself), contributed by viewers like you.

    Extensions enable pretty much arbitrary window manager behaviour to
    be implemented by users, in Haskell, in the config files.
    For more information on using and writing extensions see the webpage.
    The library of extensions is available from hackage:

        http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/xmonad-contrib

    Full documentation for using and writing your own extensions:
